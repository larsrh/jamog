# _Jamog – Just a mæss of gates_

This is the archive of a student project from around 2009.

The purpose of this project is:

* a general circuit simulator based on gates,
* a standard library of circuit components such as half-adders,
* a fully-fledged [DLX CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLX), and
* a GUI to design circuits.

There may or may not be additional stuff in this repo, such as a GUI for a DLX assembler.

I tried compiling this code with Java 11 and it did not work.

Here is a screenshot of how it is supposed to look:
